Python Practices

This repository contains my personal practices and projects while I learn Python. Each file and script here represents what I am learning and experimenting with as I progress in my studies and programming skills. The projects range from simple exercises to more complex practices, but always with the goal of learning and improving.

What's in this repository?
Here you will find a collection of practices covering basic and advanced Python topics, including:

Operators and conditionals.

Control structures such as if, for, while.

Functions and how to use them.

String and list manipulation.

File handling (reading and writing files).

Small projects like number comparators, among others.

Purpose
This repository is solely for educational purposes. It is not intended to be a finished project or production-ready, but rather a collection of examples and practices that allow me to understand and master fundamental programming concepts in Python.

How to run the scripts
Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Python from python.org.

Once Python is installed, navigate to the directory where the script you want to run is located using the terminal or command line.

Run the script with the following command:

bash
Copiar
Editar
python script_name.py
Contributions
If you have suggestions or improvements for any script, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request. Any contributions are welcome!

Notes
This repository is a work in progress. If you are a beginner, feel free to review and learn from my practices. All scripts are simple and not optimized for production. If I ever come across something more advanced, I will add it here.

Thank you for visiting and learning with me!
